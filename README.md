Simple RLC Calculator, (Not) Enough for High School Exam

## üî≠ Program's Scope

Given a simple circuit¬π consisting R, L, C and Voltage across all components.

This program will be able to calculate current passing through each component
and voltage across it.

1) For the Current Version, there can't be a circuit inside Parallel One, it's complexity is not supported yet.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
